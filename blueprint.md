# Blueprint: Photography & Videography Agency Website

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a modern, responsive website for a photography and videography agency. The website will be a multi-page application with a professional, minimalist, and elegant design, showcasing the agency's work, services, and contact information.

## Project Outline & Features

### Core Structure
- **Multi-Page Application:** The website consists of several HTML files, including a home page (`index.html`) and separate pages for Packages, About, and Contact.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to all screen sizes.
- **Modern Technologies:** Built with HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript.

### Visual Design & Aesthetics
- **Color Palette:** A minimalist and elegant color scheme with an off-white background, dark charcoal text, and a sophisticated gold accent.
- **Typography:** 'Playfair Display' for headings and 'Lato' for body text.
- **Background & Texture:** A subtle noise texture for a premium feel.
- **Depth & Effects:** Subtle, soft shadows and clean lines.
- **Iconography:** Minimalist SVG icons for navigation and communication.

### Navigation
- **Auto-hiding Navigation Bar:** The navigation bar is hidden when scrolling down and becomes visible when scrolling up, providing a less intrusive browsing experience.

### Mobile-Specific Features
- **Floating Services Button:** On small screens (<= 992px), a circular floating action button is displayed at the bottom-left corner. This button provides a quick and accessible way for mobile users to toggle the visibility of the services side panel.

### Website Pages & Sections

1.  **Header & Navigation (Consistent across all pages)**
2.  **Home Page (`index.html`)**
    -   **Testimonials Section:** A section with a slider of testimonial cards. The slider is implemented using the Slick Carousel library.
3.  **Packages Page (`packages.html`)**
4.  **About Page (`about.html`)**
    -   **Our Philosophy:** A section describing the business's philosophy.
    -   **Studio & Gear:** A section showcasing the studio and equipment with a gallery of images.
    -   **Meet the Owner:** A section with a picture and story of the owner.
5.  **Contact Page (`contact.html`)**
    - Includes a responsive Google Map iframe to display the business location.
6.  **Footer (Consistent across all pages)**

## Current Plan: Enhance About Page

The following steps will be taken to add more detailed information to the `about.html` page:

1.  **Update `blueprint.md`:** Update the blueprint to reflect the new sections on the About page and outline the current plan.
2.  **Modify `about.html`:**
    -   Add three new sections: "Our Philosophy," "Studio & Gear," and "Meet the Owner."
    -   Populate these sections with placeholder text and images that are relevant to a photography studio.
3.  **Modify `style.css`:**
    -   Add new styles to format the new sections on the About page.
    -   Create styles for an image gallery for the "Studio & Gear" section.
    -   Style the "Meet the Owner" section to have a clean layout with the owner's picture and story.
